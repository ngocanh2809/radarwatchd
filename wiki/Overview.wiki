= Introduction =

This project came about after reading a [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-weathermaps/index.html post at IBM] one day on making your own weather alerts with GD.  This is an attempt at writing a custom radar analysis package to track and predict thunderstorm cells.

The project is divided into several parts:

*daemon* - Downloads and archives radar reflectivity and velocity images from NOAA

*analysis* - Analyses radar images and stores data in an sqlite database

*UI* - User interface to view radar images and metadata
