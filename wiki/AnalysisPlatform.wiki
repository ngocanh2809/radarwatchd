#summary Overview of analysis and tracking code

= Introduction =

The analysis code is written in C/C++ using the libGD, sqlite and STL libraries.  


= Details =

The code performs several functions:
  # Loads images in radar directory searching for a specific station (NCR/reflectivity only for now) and performs analysis on each matching radar file:
    * Tracks precipitation in image
    * Locates all storm cells (current criterion is fixed threshold 50+ DBZ)
    * Performs basic analysis on cell: size, strength, weighted center of mass, average/max DBZ, standard deviation, etc
    * Writes radar image statistics and storm cell metadata to sqlite database
    * If storm cells found, radar image itself is additionally committed to database
  # Analyzes radar images in time-domain and performs removal of non-relevant images
    * Sorts images by timestamp and arranges images into groups by searching for gaps in timeline
    * Marks images for removal if no storm data detected and not in chronological proximity to other images with storm activity (removal not actually performed yet)

Code will eventually be extended to provide additional functionality:

  * Track storm cell movement based upon fuzzy logic
  * Issue warnings if cells approaching specified location(s)
  * Perform analysis on Doppler velocity data to identify mesocyclone rotation
  * Combine images from several adjacent stations into one composite file
